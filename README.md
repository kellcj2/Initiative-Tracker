# Initiative-Tracker
Easy tool to keep track of initiative for tabletop RPGs (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc).

Allows for keeping track of Initiative, Names, HP, AC, and other information (such as attacks, spell slots, etc). These can be enabled or disabled through the Options tab.

### Modify Values
Initiative, HP, and AC can be modified quickly by simply typing modifiers in the text box.
For example, if a creature's HP is at 20, just type "-5" at the end and press Enter or deselect the text box. The HP will then be updated to 15.

### Saving
You can save an encounter by going to File->Save, then typing a name for the savefile (such as "SewerBattle1"), and a save location.
In order to load the encounter, go to File->Load and select the save file that was previously created.
